# Swimming School simple React app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Project Live Link : https://simple-swimming-school-react-app.netlify.app/

### App descriptions:

In this app, you can Learn about different services of the swimming school.
There are different package for diffent categories of people.

### Home component and Services component

Both Home and Services components use Service component as a child component. Only first four data are loaded in the home page and a button to show all the services. This button actually redirects to Services component.
A custom hook named 'useServices' is used to load data and the hook is used in both the Home and Services components.

### Instructors component

The Instructors component uses anothe custom hook named 'useUsers' to load random user data. This users are shown as the instructors.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### This app is Deployed in Netlify

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
